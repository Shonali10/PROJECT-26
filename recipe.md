To start, you will need a donut pan. These are similar to muffin pans but have a hole in the middle to give you that fun donut shape. Most pans only have 6 molds in them so I recommend buying two pans. Be sure to grease the pan well as the batter can easily stick to the pan.

These chocolate glazed donuts are made from a thick chocolate cake batter. You begin by whisking together the dry and wet ingredients separately, like any basic cake batter recipe, then mix the two mixture together.

The batter is thick, so I find it easiest to fill a piping bag or ziploc bag with the batter to pipe it into the pans. You can easily do this by cutting a corner off the bottom of the bag and squeezing softly to fill the pans ¾ of the way full.

Each pan bakes for 9-10 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean. Keep a close eye on them as it’s difficult to tell if they are done since they are already dark brown and won’t turn golden like a white cake batter. Cool completely before glazing with the chocolate glaze.

The Final Step: Chocolate Glaze
No donut is complete without a frosted top! These chocolate frosted donuts get covered in a rich chocolate glaze made with bittersweet chocolate and butter. You can simply melt the ingredients, in intervals, in a microwave or use a double boiler. Be careful not to heat the chocolate too much.

Dip the top of each donut into the chocolate glaze and place on a cooling rack to set. You can even shake some sprinkles on top for a colorful finish. Since they are baked, the donuts are best enjoyed the same day or can be kept for up to 3 days in the refrigerator. Any longer and the donuts lose their moist texture, but trust me these donuts won’t last longer than a day on your kitchen counter.
